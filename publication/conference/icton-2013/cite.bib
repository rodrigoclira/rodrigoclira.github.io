 abstract = {In this paper we present a novel path restoration algorithm, named PSR-R. Our proposal is based on the power series routing (PSR) algorithm, which was proposed by Chaves et al. in 2011 for routing. The cost function for each link is given by a function expanded in a power series, considering as input variables the wavelength availability and the link length. The coefficients of the expanded function are determined by a global optimizer, which tries to minimize the rate of unsuccessful failure recovery (RUFR). We assessed our proposal by performing simulations of single link failures in a well-known network topology. The analytical model used to evaluate physical layer takes into account the following impairments: gain saturation, ASE noise depletion in the optical amplifiers, crosstalk in the optical switches, and polarization mode dispersion and residual chromatic dispersion in optical fibers. We compared our proposal with other approaches in different scenarios as a function of the network load. Our proposal outperformed all other approaches in terms of RUFR.},
