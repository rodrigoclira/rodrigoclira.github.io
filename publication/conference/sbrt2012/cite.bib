 abstract = {In this paper we compare the performance of three different restoration schemes for all-optical networks (link, subpath and path) upon a single link failure considering physical layer impairments. In addition, we propose two strategies for link or subpath restoration. Although the strategies based on subpath restoration present a better performance when compared to the strategies based on link restoration, the path restoration scheme far outperforms these other schemes. From the results, there is an indication that the path restoration is the best reactive scheme for all-optical network without wavelength conversion.},
