 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to restore calls upon double-link failures in all-optical networks. Our proposal aims to restore all the lightpaths disrupted by each failure. The algorithm performs a path restoration looking for the route that presents the higher optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). We compared our proposal to three other well known approaches in the literature. We observed that our proposal obtained lower failure rates in the restoration process for three different studied scenarios considering several physical layer impairments.},
