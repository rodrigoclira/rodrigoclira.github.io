 abstract={Neste artigo é apresentado os resultados parciais do desenvolvimento de um jogo que utiliza robótica para estimular o pensamento computacional entre crianças dos 3 aos 5 anos do ensino fundamental. O intuito do jogo é estimular o pensamento computacional nessa faixa etária, fazendo com que as crianças desenvolvam essa habilidade que é fundamental para as atuais e futuras gerações. Para realizar as missões do jogo, os jogadores necessitam pré-definir os movimentos (programa) que o robô precisa realizar para alcançar o objetivo solicitado. Na sua fase inicial, o jogo foi desenvolvido em Scratch e será, posteriormente, desenvolvido no ambiente de prototipação Arduino.},

abstract = {Optical networks have been considered as the most capable technology for supplying the ever-increasing network bandwidth demand generated by the new Internet services. However, a significant challenge for optical networks is to provide an efficient manner to recover the lost communications due to failures. A failure in a system component or an optical fiber link can shut down all the crossing lightpaths, which may lead to a decrease in the revenue for clients or some sanctions to the providers due to an unattended agreed service level. In this work, we propose an adaptive–alternative path restoration algorithm, named NrPSR-R. The proposal has an adaptation capability according to the network state. NrPSR-R finds the Nr routes with minimum cost and selects one of them using a pre-defined policy. We performed a parametric analysis of the NrPSR-R algorithm. We also compared our proposal to other well-known restoration algorithms on different scenarios and NrPSR-R outperformed the others.},

In the first proposal, named NrPSR(OSNRJE), we select the route that presents the lower OSNR that attends the Quality of Transmission requirements.

abstract = {In this paper we present a novel path restoration algorithm, named PSR-R. Our proposal is based on the power series routing (PSR) algorithm, which was proposed by Chaves et al. in 2011 for routing. The cost function for each link is given by a function expanded in a power series, considering as input variables the wavelength availability and the link length. The coefficients of the expanded function are determined by a global optimizer, which tries to minimize the rate of unsuccessful failure recovery (RUFR). We assessed our proposal by performing simulations of single link failures in a well-known network topology. The analytical model used to evaluate physical layer takes into account the following impairments: gain saturation, ASE noise depletion in the optical amplifiers, crosstalk in the optical switches, and polarization mode dispersion and residual chromatic dispersion in optical fibers. We compared our proposal with other approaches in different scenarios as a function of the network load. Our proposal outperformed all other approaches in terms of RUFR.},

We propose in this paper a novel routing algorithm, named NrPSR-Elastic, which aims to find Nr routes with minor cost for a given source-destination pair according to a cost function expanded in a Power Series (PSR). In this proposal, the coefficients are determined by a global optimizer, called Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO). We also propose a new input variable to be used in the PSR cost function, called contiguous frequency slot availability. The selected route to be assigned to the call request is chosen among the Nr found routes, depending on a Minimum Hop based policy, which takes into account the number of links in each route. We compared the performance of our proposal through simulation with the Shortest Path (SP) routing algorithm for two different link-capacity scenarios in well-known network topology. For both cases, the NrPSR-Elastic algorithm far outperformed the SP routing algorithm.},
